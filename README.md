# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

This is the third project for school.

I have used HTML and CSS for this project.

This project is about the hometowns and places in the world from which the staff of practicum are from. I chose not to include my own town, despite the guidelines, because frankly there's nothing much to say about it beyond having a few nice status on the many roundabouts.

I plan on correcting in accordance to the guidelines given to me by the school.
HOWEVER I do not plan on including NFTs in any of my works. Research has shown NFTs and Cryptocurrency cause a large amount of carbon emissions via the amount of power required to generate the currency. 
as an enviormentally concious person I ethically cannot condone these practices.
