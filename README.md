# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

This is the third project for school.

I plan on correcting in accordance to the guidelines given to me by the school.
HOWEVER I do not plan on including NFTs in any of my works. Research has shown NFTs and Cryptocurrency cause a large amount of carbon emissions via the amount of power required to generate the currency. 
as an enviormentally concious person I ethically cannot condone these practices.
